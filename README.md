Lab 11- Get Started on Bus Mall

For this lab a customer wanted a website where they can calculate specified products and their popularity from a voting system.

There are 19 images where users are allowed to select which ones they would like to see in a catalog.

After the users click which one they like after 25 rounds of selecting images they are allowed to see the results of each image (How mny times the image populated, how many times the images was selected).
